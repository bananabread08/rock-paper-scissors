# rock-paper-scissors

RCP exercise as part of the The Odin Project (TOP) curriculum. This showcases what I learned about Vanilla JS. 

v.1 : Working RCP. Play with a computer for 5 rounds.
v.2 : Added buttons and eventListeners. Still runs on the console. Will update soon. 
v.3 : Changed mode to race to 5 points and now runs on the browser. Will probably update the styling once I learned more about CSS. That's it for this RCP project.
